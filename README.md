# Mono-sand
Small falling sand demo made in an evening and a half unsing monogames and microsoft xna.

### Controlls
Use your mouse and left and right click to create and destroy particles at your cursor

### Configuration
Currently the only way to configure is to edit variables inside the Game1.cs file, the variables that are safe to change without really thinking about it are:

 **scalefactor** Scale for the whole application, some values are broken but just dont use them then.
 **colors** amount of colors availible for the gradient, bigger number slows the change down. 
 **width/height** the size of the grid of particles, changes size of screen too if other variables are left unchanged.
 **pixelwidth/height** the size in pixel of each grid element.
